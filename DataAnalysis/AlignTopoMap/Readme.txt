After CellProfiler Image analysis the user is left with a csv file that contains descriptors for each TopoChip. In this SOP, we append the 
TopoUnit FeatureIdx identifiers to the datasheet. FeatureIdx is the unique identifier of each TopoUnit surface. 

This Jupyter notebook guides the user through the process and explains how the position of the featureIdx on the TopoChip can be linked to the results of the screening.
