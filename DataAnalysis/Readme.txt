This folder contains the pipeline to run the TopoChip screening analysis. The jupyter notebooks search for input data in specific folders and therefore it is necessary to keep the following structure:
TopoChip analysis
    |
    |--> AnnotationFiles 
    |--> ImageObjects
    |--> RawData
    |--> DataAnalysis
    |--> SegmentedImages
    
The jupyter notebooks, as well as the python and matlab files can be placed in the parent folder TopoChip analysis.
