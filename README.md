# TopoChipAnalysis
This repository contained the Jupyter notebooks, python scripts and annotation files needed to analyze screening data ( in the subfolder DataAnalysis).
Before you start and download all the files, we recommend you to read SOP 4.1: Installation software and setup environment. This SOP contained detailed information on the required software and guide you through the installation of the python packages. 
After you installed and set up your environment successfully, you can start to analyze your data by following this pipeline:
1)	Image cropping and CellProfiler analysis (SOP 4.2).
2)	Aligning image analysis results with TopoMap (SOP 4.3).
3)	Identification, visualization and removal of outliers (SOP 4.4).
4)	Rank surfaces to feature of interest (SOP 4.5).
5)	Train machine learning model (SOP 4.6).

Every step has a detailed SOP to guide you through the analysis. Please note that we only guide you through the analysis and you still have to decide certain parameter settings yourself.
